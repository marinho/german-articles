# german-articles

EXPERIMENTAL web app game written with OpenUI5 to show random sequences of
nouns in German with buttons for articles to be used. The user hits one of
them to match and get points. A simple Django based web service is also in
place to provide nouns as a JSON api.

No test coverage, no care on best practices, this is just an experiment to
learn German articles and OpenUI5 wth some fun at the same time.
